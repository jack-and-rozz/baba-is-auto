//! \brief Noun class.
//!
//! This class represents object such as noun, operator and property.
//! A noun is a word that corresponds to any possible in-game sprite. A few
//! nouns like STAR) have multiple corresponding sprites, while VIOLET and
//! FLOWER words have the same corresponding sprites. A noun can be used as a
//! NOUN IS VERB statement e.g. BABA IS YOU to give it a property or as a NOUN
//! IS NOUN statement e.g. WALL IS WATER to turn an object into another object.
//! An operator is a word that goes in between properties and nouns to show the
//! relation between them.
//! A property is something that can be attached to noun words to alter their
//! behavior.
//!
